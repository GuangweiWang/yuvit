{"tagline":"An open source convertor to YUV colorspace","body":"What is YUVIT?\r\n=====\r\nYUVIT is open source command line tool that can convert images into YUV sequences or streams. This tool has two major benefits: wide formats support for output yuv images and wide formats support for input images. \r\n\r\nThis tool was started in far 2005 and was released as any2yuv on Sourceforge in 2006. It was based on Corona open source imaging library which development has been stopped in far-far 2003. I didn't maintained any2yuv since it was released, therefore it missed functionality and some bugs. But in 2011 I got several requests and bug reports about this tool. After that was decided to rewrite this tool from scratch.\r\n\r\nMeet the YUVIT for Mac, Windows and Linux. It's simply better then its predecessor. Now YUVIT uses FreeImage library, which provides support for tens image codecs like jpeg, tiff, png, pcx, bmp, gif and so on. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n        yuvit [options] [-f format] [-s uvscale] <InFile> [OutFile]\r\n\r\n        Options:\r\n                -a : Add new image to the end of output file. Don't truncate output file.\r\n                -m <start>:<end> : Multiple file input. Where:\r\n                    start : Sequence start\r\n                    end  : Sequence end\r\n                -i : Interleave UV rows for planar formats\r\n                -w : Swap UV components order\r\n\r\n        Formats (-f option):\r\n                yuv  : Planar format [DEFAULT]\r\n                yuyv : Packed format\r\n                uyvy : Packed format\r\n\r\n        UV scales (-s option. Used only with -f and planar formats):\r\n                h1v1 : UV not scaled down [DEFAULT]\r\n                h2v2 : UV scaled down by 2x horizontally and vertically\r\n                h2v1 : UV scaled down by 2x horizontally\r\n                h1v2 : UV scaled down by 2x vertically\r\n\r\n        Note: Use symbol '#' in file names for enumerators.\r\n\r\n        Examples:\r\n            yuvit -a -m 0:100 test###.bmp out.yuv\r\n                    Convert images from 'test000.bmp' to 'test100.bmp' into single 'out.yuv' file\r\n\r\n            yuvit -m 10:200 test######.jpg out###.yuv\r\n                    Convert images 'test000010.jpg'...'test000200.jpg' into files 'out010.yuv'...'out200.yuv'\r\n\r\nYUV Formats\r\n===========\r\n\r\nHere are examples of how 4x4 pixels image can be stored in YUV format depending on options (not all possible cases are shown).\r\n \r\n1) -f yuv -s h1v1 [Default]\r\n\r\n        YYYY\r\n        YYYY\r\n        UUUU\r\n        UUUU\r\n        VVVV\r\n        VVVV\r\n\r\n2) -f yuv -s h2v1\r\n\r\n        YYYY\r\n        YYYY\r\n        UU\r\n        UU\r\n        VV\r\n        VV\r\n\r\n3) -f yuv -s h1v2\r\n\r\n        YYYY\r\n        YYYY\r\n        UUUU\r\n        VVVV\r\n\r\n4) -f yuv -s h2v1 -i\r\n\r\n        YYYY\r\n        YYYY\r\n        UUVV\r\n        UUVV\r\n\r\n5) -f yuyv\r\n\r\n        YUYVYUYV\r\n        YUYVYUYV\r\n\r\n6) -f uyvy\r\n\r\n        UYVYUYVY\r\n        UYVYUYVY\r\n\r\n7) -f yuyv -w\r\n\r\n        YVYUYVYU\r\n        YVYUYVYU\r\n\r\n8) -f yuv -s h2v1 -i -w\r\n\r\n        YYYY\r\n        YYYY\r\n        VVUU\r\n        VVUU\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n======\r\n\r\n(c) 2005-2012 Alexander Shashkevych <alexander()stunpix.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nYUVIT code is licensed under LGPL.
